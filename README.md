# LIM-Toolbox (beta)

`LIM-Toolbox` is a collection of basic Matlab functions used in sound and music computing research. This also includes some tools developed at the *Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale* (University of Milan, Computer Science department) concerning bivariate signal analisys and other signal processing techniques. The project is currently not ready for distribution, nevertheless who am I to keep you from downloading and trying it?
I hope to complete the reference manual very soon.

## Requirements

It has been tested on Matlab R2015a + DSP Toolbox, but it should work even with older versions of Matlab. If it doesn't, please let me know.

## Folders content

### stdlim

`stdlim` contains common audio processing functions.

### BMS

`BMS` folder contains Bivariate Mixture Space functions and examples.

### LSF

`LSF` folder contains Linear Structure Field and Spectro-Temporal Structure Field functions and examples.
