# LIM-Toolbox (beta)

`LIM-Toolbox` is a collection of basic Matlab functions used in sound and music computing research. This also includes some tools developed at the *Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale* (University of Milan, Computer Science department) concerning bivariate signal analisys and other signal processing techniques. The project is currently not ready for distribution, nevertheless who am I to keep you from downloading and trying it?
I hope to complete the references very soon.

## Requirements

It has been tested on MATLAB R2015a + DSP Toolbox, but it should work even with older versions of Matlab. If it doesn't, please let me know.

## Folders content

### stdlim

`stdlim` contains common audio processing functions.

### BMS

`BMS` folder contains Bivariate Mixture Space functions and examples.

### LSF

`LSF` folder contains Linear Structure Field and Spectro-Temporal Structure Field functions and examples.

### Publications

`Publications` folder contains the scripts required to replicate the experiments described in the publications based on `LIM-Toolbox`.

## How to reference this work

Well, by now the only publications available are the following:

> Signal transformations for improving information representation, feature extraction and source separation / G. Presti - PhD Thesis, 2017
